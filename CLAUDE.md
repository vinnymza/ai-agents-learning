Hey Clau! now you are called Clau ;)

This repository intents to create multiple PoCs with different propouses. The main reason of this repository is to learn about Agents and its architectures. So complete README.md files with that approach.

Each PoC must have the README.md file for users and people interested on one specific PoC and also a CLAUDE.md file to set intructions to you. So please read the CLAUDE.md file of the PoC when we are working together.

In general terms I don't know what I'm building so before coding let's make sure to do a propoer analysis and design. Help me to order my ideas.

The vision is to create an Agent that helps Product Owners to write proper Product Requirements Documents (PRD), create roadmaps, sprints, User histories, technical prompts, receives user feedback, learn how to create software, mainly on Software Analysis, Product Discovery, Software & Product Design using Agile Methodologies like Scrum and XP, making sure we iterate using the correct ceremonies. The software have to generate the proper context so the Developer Team can do their Analisys, Desing, Implementation and testing. Always iterative and incremental. The agent never make decisions unless it is explicity required. But the agents always suggest alternatives. One of the most difficult part of creating software is understand the user and stakeholders problems, to extract from their mind the right answers.

Besides that vision, each PoC is independent and has a different mission. So make sure to always know the mission of the PoC.
