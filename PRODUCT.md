# AI Agent System - Product Overview

## Project Vision

Creating an autonomous AI agent system that replicates the role of a seasoned Product Owner/CTO, capable of handling the complete software development lifecycle from requirements gathering to production deployment. The ultimate goal is to have a "robotic version of myself" that can work independently or with minimal supervision.

## Context & Background

**User Profile:** Director of Software with 14 years in the industry, managing 18 developers across 5-6 teams. Former programmer (7 years) turned Engineering Manager (6 years). Has strong Product Owner skills with technical depth, but rusty on hands-on coding. Recently completed ML specialization.

**Business Goal:** Personal/experimental tool to become a lifelong assistant in software development. May eventually coordinate other AI agents. Not intended for commercialization initially, but could have business applications.

## Product Requirements

### Core Capabilities
- **Requirements Analysis:** Interact with clients or read requirement documents
- **Functional Analysis:** Break down requirements into epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria  
- **Technical Translation:** Generate appropriate technical prompts for development tools (Claude Code)
- **Collaborative Intelligence:** Enable back-and-forth questioning between the agent and development tools
- **Context Awareness:** Understand client patterns, project history, and business context
- **Continuous Learning:** Accumulate experience and improve decision-making over time

### Target Architecture
**Multi-Agent System with Collaborative Intelligence:**
- **Product Owner Agent:** Business analysis, requirements breakdown, user story creation
- **Staff Engineer Agent:** Technical feasibility, architecture decisions, implementation guidance
- **Engineering Manager Agent:** Coordination between agents, process optimization, quality assurance

**Key Principles:**
- Collaborative rather than sequential workflow
- Agents question each other to avoid bias and improve decisions
- Knowledge transfer between agents for better precision
- Iterative and incremental development approach

## Technical Stack

**Development Framework:**
- Backend: NestJS
- Frontend: NextJS  
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Agent Implementation: Python scripts using Anthropic API
- Communication: JSON-based inter-agent messaging

## First Use Case: Better Jira Alternative

**Business Context:** Current Jira costs $8 USD per person, but most teams only use 20% of features. Opportunity to create something simpler and more effective.

**Initial Feature:** Login with Google OAuth integration

**Target Users:** Paroz Labs (current employer) - potential for later commercialization

## Development Approach

### Phase Structure
1. **Analysis Phase:** Learn, question status quo, discovery of AI agents technology
2. **Design Phase:** Creative solutions within best practices, multiple design alternatives
3. **Development Phase:** PoC → MVP → v1.0, iterative and incremental
4. **Testing Phase:** Coherence testing, functionality validation
5. **Production Phase:** Early productionization even for PoC

### Current Development Stage
**PoC Phase:** Building basic 3-agent system with simple communication mechanism
- Product Owner Agent generates dynamic requirements
- Staff Engineer Agent responds with technical solutions
- Engineering Manager Agent coordinates and synthesizes

### Success Metrics
- Agent can understand and break down requirements effectively
- Technical solutions are feasible and well-architected
- Agents demonstrate learning and improvement over iterations
- System can handle increasingly complex projects with minimal human intervention

## Future Vision
- Multi-agent coordination for complete software factories
- Integration with various development tools beyond Claude Code
- Autonomous project management and delivery
- Knowledge base that grows with each project
- Proactive suggestions and optimizations
