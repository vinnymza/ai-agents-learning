# Development Session Log

## Current Status: PoC Development Phase

### What We've Accomplished

#### 1. Project Foundation ✅
- Created comprehensive product vision and requirements
- Defined multi-agent collaborative architecture
- Selected technical stack: NestJS + NextJS + PostgreSQL
- Chose Python for agent implementation with Anthropic API

#### 2. Basic Agent Communication System ✅
- Built 3 basic Python scripts that communicate via JSON
- Established communication pattern through `shared/communication.json`
- Created roles: Product Owner, Staff Engineer, Engineering Manager
- Implemented sequential execution with `run.py` orchestrator

#### 3. Current File Structure ✅
```
/agents/
  - product_owner.py (basic hardcoded responses)
  - staff_engineer.py (reads PO output, generates tech solution)
  - engineering_manager.py (coordinates and synthesizes)
/shared/
  - communication.json (inter-agent messaging)
- run.py (orchestrator script)
- requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Test Case: Google OAuth Login ✅
- Successfully demonstrated agent collaboration on real feature
- Each agent contributed from their domain expertise
- Communication flow working as designed

### ✅ COMPLETED: Full Dynamic Agent System

#### ✅ All Agents Now Dynamic and Collaborative
**Achievement:** Successfully created a complete multi-agent system that collaborates dynamically

**What Works:**
- **Product Owner Agent:** Generates dynamic requirements using Anthropic API
- **Staff Engineer Agent:** Creates technical solutions responding to actual PO output
- **Engineering Manager Agent:** Provides executive decision-making and execution plans
- **Inter-agent Communication:** JSON messaging system working perfectly
- **Sequential Execution:** Resolved timing issues by running agents sequentially

**Successful Test Cases:**
1. "Implementar dashboard de analytics" - Generated comprehensive analytics requirements
2. "Implementar sistema de notificaciones" - Created detailed notification system plan
3. All agents communicate contextually and build on each other's work

### Next Steps (Prioritized)

#### ✅ COMPLETED THIS SESSION
1. ✅ **Complete PO Agent Dynamic Integration** - Working perfectly with Anthropic API
2. ✅ **Make Staff Engineer Agent Dynamic** - Responds contextually to PO requirements  
3. ✅ **Test Full Dynamic Flow** - Successfully tested with multiple project types
4. ✅ **Fix Agent Coordination** - Resolved timing issues with sequential execution

#### Ready for Next Phase

#### Short Term (Next Sessions)
1. **Engineering Manager Intelligence**
   - Add Anthropic API integration
   - Implement conflict resolution logic
   - Add iteration management

2. **Improve Agent Prompts**
   - Add domain expertise to each agent
   - Include project context awareness
   - Add quality validation

3. **Better Communication Protocol**
   - Add error handling
   - Implement feedback loops
   - Add conversation history

#### Medium Term
1. **Knowledge Persistence**
   - Store project context
   - Remember previous decisions
   - Build learning capabilities

2. **Integration with Claude Code**
   - Generate development prompts
   - Handle back-and-forth questions
   - Automate development workflow

3. **Jira Alternative Development**
   - Use agent system to build the actual product
   - Test real-world usage
   - Iterate based on results

### Key Learnings So Far

1. **Claude Code is intelligent** - Inferred agent communication patterns well
2. **JSON communication works** - Simple but effective for PoC
3. **Role separation is clear** - Each agent has distinct responsibilities
4. **Sequential flow is good start** - But need to move to collaborative model
5. **Real use case helps** - Google OAuth login provided concrete context

### Technical Debt / Decisions to Revisit

1. **Communication Method** - JSON files vs database vs API calls
2. **Error Handling** - Currently minimal, need robust error management
3. **Agent Memory** - No persistence between runs yet
4. **Scalability** - How to add more agents or complexity
5. **Security** - API key management and agent isolation

### Success Criteria for Next Session

- [ ] PO Agent generates different outputs for different inputs
- [ ] Staff Engineer Agent responds contextually to PO requirements
- [ ] Full workflow runs without hardcoded data
- [ ] Can test with multiple project types beyond login
- [ ] Ready to add Engineering Manager intelligence

### Questions for Future Sessions

1. How do we measure agent output quality?
2. When do we move from sequential to collaborative model?
3. How do we implement learning/memory between sessions?
4. What's the best way to integrate with Claude Code workflow?
5. How do we handle conflicting agent recommendations?
