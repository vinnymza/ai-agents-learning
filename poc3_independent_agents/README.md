# PoC 3: Independent Agents Architecture

> **Status**: 🚀 **READY FOR TESTING**  
> **Innovation**: True component independence with direct communication  
> **Architecture**: Each component owns its memory and reasoning, no centralization

## 🎯 The Core Concept

This PoC implements truly independent agents that coordinate through direct method calls rather than centralized orchestration. Each component has its own memory, AI connection, and business logic, solving the architectural dead end encountered in PoC2.

## 🔑 Key Architectural Innovations

### 1. **True Component Independence**
- Each component has its own memory file and structure
- Each component has its own AI connection and prompts
- No shared reasoning or centralized processing
- Components coordinate through clean interfaces

### 2. **Smart Communication Filtering**
- AI-powered classification of user input
- Simple interactions handled directly by Communication
- Complex requirements routed to Consciousness
- Conversational context maintained across interactions

### 3. **Shared Context Management**
- Consciousness manages project-wide state
- Requirements tracking and decision history
- Global context available to all components
- No bottlenecks or single points of failure

### 4. **Memory Separation**
- Business logic separate from persistence logic
- Each component understands its own data structure
- Easy to swap storage backends (JSON → Database)
- Clean abstractions with MemoryManager

### Component Flow
```
User Input → Communication (AI Filter) → 
├── Simple (greetings) → Communication handles directly
└── Complex (requirements) → Consciousness → Decisions → UserStoryCreator
                                         ↓
                                    Stories created → Communication displays
```

## 🧪 How to Run

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python main.py
```

Start a conversation and provide requirements like:
- "I need a user login system"
- "Users should be able to reset their passwords"
- "Show me the stories we've created"

### Demo Mode
```bash
python main.py --demo
```

Runs with predefined requirements to showcase the system capabilities.

User: "I need a login system for my app"
Agent: "I've created user story US001: User Authentication

As a user, I want to log into the application so that I can access my personal account and data.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can enter email and password on login form
2. System validates credentials against user database
3. User is redirected to dashboard upon successful login
4. System displays error message for invalid credentials
5. User account is locked after 5 failed login attempts"

User: "Thanks!"
Agent: "You're welcome! The login story is ready. Any other features you'd like to add to your application?"
```
